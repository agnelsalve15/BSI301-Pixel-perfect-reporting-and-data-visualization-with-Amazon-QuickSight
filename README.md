  # BSI301-Pixel-perfect-reporting-and-data-visualization-with-Amazon-QuickSight
This repository contains my work from the BSI301 workshop focused on building pixel-perfect reports and creating powerful data visualizations using Amazon QuickSight. During the workshop, I learned how to:

Set up and configure Amazon QuickSight for data analysis and visualization.
Create visually appealing, interactive dashboards for insightful reporting.
Leverage AWS services to integrate various data sources into QuickSight.
Apply advanced features like calculated fields and dynamic filters to enhance visualizations.
Share and collaborate on reports, making data-driven decisions accessible to stakeholders.
The skills gained from this workshop are foundational for creating interactive and visually impactful reports for business intelligence using cloud-based services.
